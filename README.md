## Notes

One of the main problems I faced in this project was using the network request through the AFNetworking Pod as well as the search bar. I have coded similar network requests in other languages, so the structure was pretty familiar and the actual API implementation wasn't too dificult. What was dificult was making sure I had the syntax correct.

An area that I noticed that I improved in was understanding the structure and syntax of Objective C in Xcode. I was also happy to know that by the end of the week, I was able to understand how to detect bugs and decode them using the Xcode developer tools.
